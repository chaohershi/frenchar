Frenchar is a Windows utility written in [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/). It helps you input special French characters faster and easier.

## Feature ##
While typing, Frenchar makes auto replacements for you, so that you can "type out" special French characters (French accents and French ligature) using regular QWERTY keyboards.

## Download ##
You can download the compiled standalone executable `Frenchar.exe` [here](https://github.com/chaohershi/frenchar/releases). No installation required.

Alternatively, you can download the source code and run the script `Frenchar.ahk` having AutoHotkey installed.

**Please be aware that you may get a popup message from Windows SmartScreen when running the executable.** The message would state that "Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting." This is totally normal. It takes some time for a new certificate, like the one that Frenchar is using, to get recognized. Nevertheless, Frenchar is free and minimal and contains no malware of any kind. Feel free to do a virus scan if you are worried!

To run Frenchar from Windows SmartScreen, click on the "More info" link and then click on the "Run anyway" button.
